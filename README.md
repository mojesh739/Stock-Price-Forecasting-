Novelaty in this model is add convolution layer in the Lstm model


# Stock Market Forecasting Using Hybrid Time Series and Deep Learning Models

## 📖 Overview
This project presents a hybrid stock market forecasting framework that combines
classical time series techniques with advanced deep learning architectures to
improve prediction accuracy on financial time series data.

The proposed hybrid model, TES-ED-DA-ConvLSTM-BO, integrates time series
decomposition, dual attention mechanisms, encoder-decoder architecture,
convolutional LSTM networks, and Bayesian Optimization.
